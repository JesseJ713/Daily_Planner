# Description

With this program, the user will be allowed to submit entries into a daily planner that will track current time and display visually a schedule of said users' work day. Functionality of this program includes: 
* Current Time and Date
* Accurate representation of time within the schedule
* Customizable timeblocks that persist when user leaves the page

## Project Status

Bit of a late start, but I have just finished pseudocoding and my plan is to tackle this project without touching the HTML & CSS. I want to solidify my knowledge manipulating the DOM and using jQuery to do so. I began by adding and establishing the current time and date onto the page.

Creating the skeleton/layout of the program was more intuitive than anticipated. Using jQuery helped cut a lot of the code out of the equation. Now I need to focus on representing the time correctly within the schedule part of the program, laying out the body efficiently, and manipulate local storage correctly.
