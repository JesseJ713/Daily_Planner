# Description

With this program, the user will be allowed to submit entries into a daily planner that will track current time and display visually a schedule of said users' work day. Functionality of this program includes: 
* Current Time and Date
* Accurate representation of time within the schedule
* Color coordination that visualizes hours relative to the actual time of day
* Customizable timeblocks that persist when user leaves the page

## Project Status

Bit of a late start, but I have just finished pseudocoding and my plan is to tackle this project without touching the HTML & CSS. I want to solidify my knowledge manipulating the DOM and using jQuery to do so. I began by adding and establishing the current time and date onto the page.

Creating the skeleton/layout of the program was more intuitive than anticipated. Using jQuery helped cut a lot of the code out of the equation. Now I need to focus on representing the time correctly within the schedule part of the program, laying out the body efficiently, and manipulate local storage correctly.

I've effectively layed out the body by manipulating columns within Bootstrap. I was able to store the data inputted in the body, but need to work on having it persist as the user leaves the page. I also still need to work on portraying the hours correctly from the global variable I have set up. I will spend a little more time on it before reaching out for help.

Finishing up the project, I was able to reach out for assistance portraying the correct hours onto each time block and reach into local storage to have user data persist. Coloring the blocks relative to the current hour was pretty fun as well! The functionality of the program is dynamic and majority of the page loads all within ONE function! Super exciting progress!
